# This exercise is to create a text game similar to the last exercise.
# The premise: Traversing a plain of obstacles to achieve freedom.

# I am also using this file to mark progress. Parts completed will be indented another tab length.

# Rooms:
        # The Nest (unit)
    # The Open Night ('dark')
    # The Open Day ('light')
    # The Airport (disguised freedom)
    # The Terminal (illusion of being almost there)
    # The Plane (a bitter taste of freedom)
    # The Destination (false freedom)
    # Contentment (real freedom)


# Monsters:
    # The Nest
        # The Big Scary Nothing (initial hesitation)
# The Open Night
    # Silhouette (the unknown)
# The Airport
    # A Crowd of Businessmen (the pressure)
# The Terminal
    # The Intimidating Squirrel (last minute pull out)


# Traps:
# The Open Day
    # Café (the known)
# The Airport
    # Did you bring your passport? (commitment)
# The Plane
    # Drinks multiple (5 or more and you're stuck?)
# The Destination
    # The feeling of "I did it!" (illusion, sends back to the beginning)
