# This exercise is to create a text game similar to the last exercise.
# The premise: Traversing a plain of obstacles to achieve freedom.

# I am also using this file to mark progress. Parts completed will be indented another tab length.

# Key:
    * Monsters = game over
    * Traps = reset to previous room

# Rooms:
        # The Nest (unit)
        # The Open Day ('light')
        # The Open Night ('dark')
        # The Airport (disguised freedom)
        # The Terminal (illusion of being almost there)
        # The Plane (a bitter taste of freedom)
        # The Destination (false freedom)
        # Contentment (real freedom)


# Monsters:
    # The Nest
        # The Big Scary Nothing (initial hesitation)
    # The Open Night
        # Silhouette (the unknown)
    # The Terminal
        # The Intimidating Flight Attendant (last minute pull out)


# Traps:
    # The Open Day
        # Caf√© (the known)
    # The Airport
        # A Crowd of Businessmen (the pressure)
    # The Plane
        # Drinks multiple (5 or more and you're stuck?)
    # The Destination
        # The feeling of "I did it!" (illusion, sends back to the beginning)
